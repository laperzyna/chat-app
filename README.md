## Summary
This is a chat application that uses TCP and UDP connections. The output of this project should be that two users are able to communicate
with each other, even if on different lab computers. Each user's presence will be broadcasted and may establish a connection with another
user and send a TCP message to that person. In return that person may send a message back to their connection.

## Future Development
At the moment this application has a bug. Users are able to connect and broadcast their presence. For now only one user can send a message 
to their connection and that connected user may see that message, however that user may not be able to send a message back. This bug is in the works to fix.
